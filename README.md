# 3300-Final-Project
Final project for ECE3300 (Digital Circuit Design with Verilog) with Ethan Song. This project was a music player that had 3 songs that activated based on switches with a reset serving as a "pause" button. Along with playing music, we used the VGA component to display the song number on a screen hooked up to an external monitor. :D
