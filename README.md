# 3300-Final-Project
Final project for ECE3300 (Digital Circuit Design with Verilog) with Ethan Song (@stester198). This project was a music player that had 3 songs that activated based on switches with a reset serving as a "pause" button. Along with playing music, we used the VGA component to display the song number on a screen hooked up to an external monitor. :D

Our abstract: 
This Verilog Project utilizes the Nexys A7 FPGA development board to create an interactive music player system. Three dedicated switches allow the user to select from three pre-made songs, with a corresponding numeric identifier displayed on the seven-segment display. There is also a VGA output that shows the corresponding number via a monitor. An LED light has been implemented to light up and turn off for every note, to show the duration of a note being played. A reset button is also incorporated to stop the playback and reset the song. The project utilizes the PWM Audio Amplifier in the constraints file to output audio. Songs are stored in case statements to play specific notes sequentially for a specified duration. The frequency of the notes has been calculated according to the clock speed to hit the right sound frequency when being played back. This project showcases the Nexys A7 FPGA’s potential with audio playback and provides a base foundation of being able to play sounds at specific frequencies for a period of time.
